This is an app that I developed so my son could smash around on my keyboard.

The main beauty of this app is that it disables all the keyboard keys that could exit the program or otherwise adjust computer settings. Thus, my son can click, type, and smash without disrupting my actual computer's files and setup. While running, the app disables the windows key using a third party app, WinKill. It also disables the alt, esc, and shift buttons. Once the program is running, the only way to exit the app is by pressing shift + esc (which is typed in the GUI if you forget). 

Features
* A simple, full-screen GUI with buttons, text boxes, etc.
* Use of tkinter, os, and sys libraries

To use the program:
1. Download the files in the .exe Application folder. 
2. Once downloaded, the two WinKill files need to be in the same folder location as the .exe file.
3. Run the smashApp.exe
4. To close, type shift + esc

Below are known "bugs," aka other ways your toddler can mess things up while keyboard smashing:
* The power button on your computer is not disabled. Follow this tutorial to disable this button manually in windows: https://www.howtogeek.com/722865/how-to-disable-your-pcs-power-button-on-windows-10/
* Any trackpad shortcuts are not disabled. My computer has finger swipe actions that would minimize the app. To disable these: press windows button -> trackpad settings -> finger gestures -> do nothing.

App's functionality is complete March 2024. There are lots of improvements to the GUI that I plan to make.
