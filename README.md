This is an app that I developed so my son could smash around on my keyboard.

The main beauty of this app is that it disables all the keyboard keys that could exit the program or otherwise adjust computer settings. Thus, my son can click, type, and smash without disrupting my actual computer's files and setup. The app disables the windows key using a third party app, WinKill. It also disables the alt, esc, and shift buttons. Once the program is running, the only way to exit the app is by pressing shift + esc (which is typed in the GUI if you forget). 

Features
* A simple, full-screen GUI with buttons, text boxes, etc.
* Use of tkinter, os, and sys libraries

To use the program:
download the files in Keyboard-Smash-App/.exe files
